<p>In the world of software development, test coverage is a critical metric that reflects the effectiveness of your testing strategy. However, as developers, we often find ourselves navigating the nuances of <strong>line coverage</strong> and <strong>branch coverage</strong>, and the gap between them can reveal untold stories about our code.</p>

<p>This article explores how a project with <strong>26% line coverage</strong> and <strong>69% branch coverage</strong> tells a deeper tale, the practical implications of these metrics, and actionable strategies to achieve the coveted <strong>100% coverage</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-starting-point"><strong>The Starting Point</strong></h2>
<p>Our project began with the following test coverage metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Line Coverage:</strong> 26%</li>
  <li><strong>Branch Coverage:</strong> 69%</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers sparked both concern and curiosity. How could we have tested 69% of our logical paths while executing only 26% of our lines of code? Diving into the details, we discovered that our tests focused heavily on <strong>branch logic</strong>—decision points like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> conditions and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch</code> cases—but missed other critical parts of the codebase.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="understanding-the-metrics"><strong>Understanding the Metrics</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-line-coverage"><strong>1. Line Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Measures the percentage of lines of code that are executed during testing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low line coverage (26%)</strong> indicates many parts of the code were never executed, including non-conditional statements.</li>
  <li>This can result in untested initialization code, helper methods, and error handling blocks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-branch-coverage"><strong>2. Branch Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Focuses on logical paths, ensuring both the <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong> branches of conditional statements are evaluated.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High branch coverage (69%)</strong> means a substantial portion of decision logic was tested, but not necessarily the full extent of its execution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example"><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Positive"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Negative"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Done"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>A test with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = -1</code> will achieve <strong>100% branch coverage</strong> because both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> branches are executed.</li>
  <li>However, <strong>line coverage</strong> might be lower if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Console.WriteLine("Done");</code> is never reached during tests.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-challenges"><strong>The Challenges</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-gaps-in-line-coverage"><strong>1. Gaps in Line Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Our test suite skipped parts of the code outside conditional logic. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initialization routines were left untested.</li>
  <li>Edge cases, such as exception handling, were ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-over-reliance-on-branch-testing"><strong>2. Over-reliance on Branch Testing</strong></h3>
<p>While the logical branches were adequately tested, their consequences—like calls to external APIs or database interactions—remained unchecked.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="action-plan-achieving-100-coverage"><strong>Action Plan: Achieving 100% Coverage</strong></h2>
<p>Reaching 100% coverage requires addressing both metrics systematically:</p>

<h3 id="1-target-uncovered-lines"><strong>1. Target Uncovered Lines</strong></h3>
<p>Analyze the coverage report to identify lines missed during tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add tests to execute helper methods and initialization code.</li>
  <li>Cover all paths that lead to those lines, even in non-critical scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-expand-branch-testing"><strong>2. Expand Branch Testing</strong></h3>
<p>Ensure all logical branches are <strong>fully explored</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test not only the decision points but also their side effects.</li>
  <li>Cover nested conditions and boundary values comprehensively.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-test-error-handling"><strong>3. Test Error Handling</strong></h3>
<p>Write tests that deliberately trigger exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simulate failures such as database connection errors or invalid inputs.</li>
  <li>Ensure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try-catch</code> blocks and fallback logic are exercised.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-automate-coverage-monitoring"><strong>4. Automate Coverage Monitoring</strong></h3>
<p>Incorporate tools like <strong>ReportGenerator</strong> and CI/CD pipelines to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Track coverage metrics continuously.</li>
  <li>Fail builds that drop below the expected threshold.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-practice-test-driven-development-tdd"><strong>5. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong></h3>
<p>By writing tests before the implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You naturally ensure all lines of the new code are executed.</li>
  <li>TDD forces coverage considerations upfront.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-payoff"><strong>The Payoff</strong></h2>
<p>By methodically addressing these gaps, our project began to evolve:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Line Coverage</strong> steadily rose as we executed untested parts of the code.</li>
  <li><strong>Branch Coverage</strong> improved further as we explored more nuanced conditions.</li>
  <li>Both metrics converged toward 100%, signaling robust test coverage and fewer hidden bugs.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="suggestions-for-next-steps"><strong>Suggestions for Next Steps</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Focus on Maintainability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>As tests grow, ensure they are well-documented and easy to modify.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize Code Quality:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Coverage should be paired with quality metrics like cyclomatic complexity to avoid over-testing simple paths.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Embrace Mutation Testing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Tools like <strong>Stryker.NET</strong> can validate that your tests not only run but also catch intentional bugs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Test coverage is more than a number; it’s a narrative of how thoroughly you’ve validated your code. While <strong>26% line coverage</strong> and <strong>69% branch coverage</strong> highlighted gaps in our approach, they also served as a roadmap for improvement. By leveraging tools, expanding tests, and embracing best practices, we can transform these metrics into a testament to software excellence.</p>

<p>With persistence and a clear strategy, the journey from <strong>26% to 100%</strong> becomes an achievable—and immensely rewarding—goal.</p>

<p>Building a CRUD API for managing products is a fundamental exercise in ASP.NET Core development. While it may seem straightforward, this process reveals technical challenges that test our ability to handle real-world development cycles. In this article, we will review the API development process, highlight common errors and their solutions, and provide suggestions for future improvements.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="project-overview"><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>

<p>We developed an API to manage a product catalog. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and was implemented with the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET Core 8.0</strong> for API development.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> for database interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>MS SQL Server</strong> as the relational database.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker and Docker Compose</strong> to containerize and manage infrastructure.</li>
  <li><strong>xUnit</strong> for automated testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Swagger</strong> for API documentation and interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application was configured to run both locally and inside Docker containers, ensuring flexibility.</p>

<h2 id="common-errors-and-their-solutions"><strong>Common Errors and Their Solutions</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-error-the-instance-of-entity-type-product-cannot-be-tracked"><strong>1. Error: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The instance of entity type 'Product' cannot be tracked</code></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
During updates with EF Core, this error occurred because two instances of the same object were being tracked in the same context.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
We used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsNoTracking()</code> method for queries where tracking was unnecessary. For updates, we ensured only one instance of the entity was used:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">existingProduct</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">_dbContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Products</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">AsNoTracking</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nf">FirstOrDefaultAsync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span>

<h3 id="3-error-mapping-the-sa-user-to-the-database"><strong>3. Error Mapping the sa User to the Database</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
The error Cannot use the special principal ‘sa’ occurred while mapping the sa user to the CatalogDb database.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
We configured SQL Server to allow SQL authentication logins.
We created a new login and mapped it to the database with appropriate permissions:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="n">LOGIN</span> <span class="n">cataloguser</span> <span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="n">PASSWORD</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'securePassword'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h3 id="4-failing-test-assertnotempty"><strong>4. Failing Test: Assert.NotEmpty()</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
A test checking if the containers were “running” returned an empty result.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
We ensured the containers were correctly configured and running.
We updated the tests to use the Docker.DotNet library and validated container logs for additional insights.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="technologies-well-employed"><strong>Technologies Well Employed</strong></h2>

<p><strong>1. ASP.NET Core and EF Core:</strong>
EF Core simplified database interactions, and ASP.NET Core provided a robust framework for API development.</p>

<p><strong>2. Docker:</strong>
Containerizing the application and database ensured a consistent environment for development and testing.</p>

<p><strong>3. Swagger:</strong>
Automatically documented the API, making it accessible for developers and integrators.</p>

<p><strong>4. xUnit and Automated Tests:</strong>
Tests ensured code quality and helped detect regressions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="suggestions-for-future-versions"><strong>Suggestions for Future Versions</strong></h2>

<p><strong>1. Authentication and Authorization:</strong>
Implement JWT-based authentication to secure the endpoints.</p>

<p><strong>2. Monitoring:</strong>
Integrate tools like Application Insights or Prometheus/Grafana for performance monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data Validation:</strong>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
